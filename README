R API for CORELS

To install, cd into the rcorels directory and run

# R CMD INSTALL .

Within R, you can use the function train.corels() to train the CORELS model. The predict.corels() and print.corels() functions can be used to apply the resulting model to a set of test data, or print the model, respectively.

Data and manual pages coming soon.
