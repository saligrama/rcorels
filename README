R API for CORELS

More details to come soon when code is cleaned up and so on.

To install, cd into the rcorels directory and run

# R CMD INSTALL .

Within R, you can use the function train() to train the CORELS model. The predict() and print() functions can be used to apply the resulting model to a set of test data, or print the model, respectively.

Data and manual pages coming soon.
